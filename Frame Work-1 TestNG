// setup TestNg for eclipse
To download -> Eclipse / Help /eclipse workspace / search TestNG(instal) / next(agreement) / restart.
To check installed or not -> Window / preferences / search TestNG / got means installed.

// Start with New Project in Eclipse
* New / Project / JAVA PROJECT(next) / Enter name(finish) / skip pop-up.
* Src / create package / Enter name(finish)
* In Package / crate class.

TestNg will run without main method - by using Test anoation.(Add testNG libraries & import package [org.testng.annotations.Test;])
@Test
	public void demo() {
		System.out.println("Rahul");
	}
note:- we can create multiple test cases in single class.


//To create XML file in a project / suite file to run project.
* right click on project -> TestNG -> convert to testNG(xml file will generate at down) -> from there we can run all test cases.

//we can run multiple classes & separate test case in single class through XML.(Include/Exclude methods) 
example :- 
<suite>
<test name="AirApiReport-TestExecution">                                                [ simply giving one name]
        <classes>                              
            <class name="com.odysol.webautomation.affiliates.test.AirApiReportTest">    [ class name]
                <methods>
                    <include name="Ody2AirRSLogReport"/>
                </methods>
            </class>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
note :- *  we can use regular expression in names ( <include name="mobile.*"/> the method name which will start from mobile will execute).
        *  like that we can execute full package. by passing <packages> <package name="test"/> </packages> instead of <classes>
